The test cases are developed to see if the updated code works satisfyingly or not.

According to the requirement document, given code contained bugs and some potential run time exceptions that needed to be taken care of.

Question code has been divided to five different modules according to the class name and functionality.

I have taken four modules or test cases by which we can test if the application works fine.

I have tried to find as many bugs as I can to make the code working.

Attached file contains the test cases with appropriate class names so that developers can understand what is being tested as wells as the question code divided into five different modules according to the functionality and to avoid the unneccessary complex code.
